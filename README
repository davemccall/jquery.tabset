tabset

A very simple jQuery tabset widget

Will turn every even item within the container element
into a tab and every odd item into a content page.
When tabs are clicked, tabs display (and the others hide).
By default the first tab will be selected.

Documentation and licence in js header.

sample.htm will show usage.
